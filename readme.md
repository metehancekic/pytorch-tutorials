# PyTorch Tutorials

Through my research, I have been working on python and pytorch codes.  Along the way, my coding style transformed extensively, since I am exposed to "stack overflow" many times and different coding styles while struggling to implement specific research ideas and/or debugging. In this repo, I provide a simple and compact code template for image classification and adversarial machine learning. Hoping that it would be helpful for beginners.
